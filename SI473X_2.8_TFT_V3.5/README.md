I made a new version of my program. V3.5. First of all, fixed some bugs that were pointed out to me by users, such as a nasty error in the BFO frequency with crystal control. I was asked several times if the horizontal screen could be rotated 180 degrees. I have added that option in the display selection. Furthermore, the lack of the North and South American band plan was felt as a loss. I have also added that to the selection. Also added 200kHz steps for FM. The lack of a battery condition meter is experienced as a nuisance. In the selection you can now choose for the condition of a 3.7 volt LiPo (Lithium Polymer) battery. This is also the battery of the ATS25. However, this requires a change to the hardware. Two 18K ohm resistors must be added to the battery terminals and a wire from the junction of these two resistors to GPIO35 on the ESP32 controller. This requires soldering. If you don't have soldering experience I wouldn't make this change. I do not assume any responsibility for radio failure during or after making this modification. SO IT IS ENTIRELY YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY.
